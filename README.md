# Coding Standards
This is a little repo to document my coding standards and styles for easy reference.


## Indentation
Tabs

1 Tab = 4 spaces

## Curly brackets
Start curly brackets on if else blocks and functions should be on the same line as the declaration with a space before the curly bracket.

```js

if () {
else {

function thing() {
```

## else
`else if` and `else` blocks should be on a new line after the previous closing curly bracket

```js
if () {
}
else if () {
}
else {
}
```
